# AureliaCasts Finished Blog

This repository represents the end-state of the blog created in the [Aurelia JS Frontend Framework: The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxo86ctKorEiEItOZpbjZi9LSboZ0qFt9) tutorial series.

## Getting Started

I would recommend getting started by following along with the [videocasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxo86ctKorEiEItOZpbjZi9LSboZ0qFt9); however, if you would prefer to just check out the completed blog, the following sections will instruct you on how to clone down the repository, install dependencies, and build/serve the application.

### Prerequisites

To run this repository locally, you should first have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed and second have the Aurelia Command Line Inteface (CLI) installed globally.

```
npm i -g aurelia-cli
```

### Installing

Clone the repository to a local directory (in this case, the `blog` directory is used)

```
git clone https://github.com/NickShallee/finished-blog.git blog
```

Change into the new directory

```
cd blog
```

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

Finally, use the Aurelia CLI to build and server the app on port 9000

```
au run
```

You can now go to your browser and view the application at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)!

## Contributing

As this repository is meant to be historical record for the AureliaCasts Tutorial Series, I am not accepting pull requests at this time. However, to discuss other opportunities for collaboration, including future lesson ideas, please contact me.
